## What's this?

Dominion is a completely open-source, free, future-proof, territory protection plugin developed specifically for
high-level releases. The plugin is currently undergoing rapid development and iteration, and we will do our best to
ensure the stability and functionality of the plugin.

Regarding the functions and features of this plug-in, you can view [Introduction](intro/intro_en-us.md)

## Version Support

- 1.20.1+ (Bukkit、Spigot、Paper、Folia)

> You need to use Java21 to run your server. If you are still using Java17, you can safely replace it with Java21. In
> theory, version 1.20.1+ can be directly upgraded to Java21.

> Although this plugin supports Spigot, we strongly recommend that you upgrade your core to Paper or its forked (such as
> Purpur) for a better performance experience.
